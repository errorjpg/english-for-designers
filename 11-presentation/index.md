# Visual style and communication strategy for the EFEST festival 

## About festival

EFEST is a festival that combines electronic music and visual art. Special unique visual, light projections and installations created by global design and 3D-graphics studios, independent Russian media artists and artists in the field of audiovisual art are prepared for the festival. 

The organizer of the event is the "Center for Realization of Cultural Projects". The event is supported by the Ministry of Culture.

The main idea of the festival is to use special effects and electronic music to create the illusion of outer space, and give people the opportunity to feel it and get away from the surface of the Earth for a while. A special characteristic of the festival lies primarily in the unique and unusual idea of the event, which includes a large number of different creative manifestations using innovative technology combined with incredible electronic music. The festival activities are intended to allow people to diversify their daily leisure time in an unusual environment, cultural development and recreation, to get positive and vivid emotions, as well as recharged with the energy of the event.

## Visual Style 

The festival has two directions EFEST Music and EFEST Light, so I had to create a visual style that would highlight the characteristics of each event, but also unite them between each other. That's why I decided to create graphic figures for these directions. I also made these figures in 3D style to emphasize the futuristic and point to the theme of this festival. 

**Logo**

For the visual concept of the festival I made one general logo, which is made using a simple typographic font. And also for each direction two separate logos were created. They consist of the main festival logo and an additional typography that indicates a specific event.

**Colors**

The festival has a very bright and intense program, and this is the main part of its theme. Therefore, it was important to choose a neutral color that could go well with the photos from this festival. As well as on all the promotional products. So I decided to use just the color matalic with highlights of other colors. And the logos were left in basic black to make the concept look harmonious.
