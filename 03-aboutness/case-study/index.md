# Project Povstalec - Redesign VÅ KK student magazine

* Design of whole magazine: logo update, visual style, cover, layouts
* Elizaveta Vakalova 


## About the project
This design project was the main assignment last year from Atelier, and each of our group had to prepare their own vision for our school magazine. We had very little time for this project, but I tried to make it as creative and unusual as possible, which would correspond to a magazine for our creative university, which is why I would like to share this project with you.


My main goal in this project was to get students interested in the magazine and attract their attention. Since our university has a huge number of different specialties in education, it was necessary to pay attention to each of them. But it had to be remembered that all these directions have one important factor in common, and that is creativity.

## Design and Idea
A magazine in the form of a sketchbook or Artbook, done in a modern motif, with interesting layouts and attractive illustrations

## Logo
I decided to make the logo so that it would combine well and be part of the logo of our university, so that when we look at it we know exactly what kind of magazine it is.

## Cover

The cover looks pretty simple and strange, the emphasis here is on the notebook of a creative person, where there is a kind of chaos, but at the same time we can, with the help of fake stickers, understand what this issue of the magazine is about and what will be there.
