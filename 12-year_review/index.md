# Review

### 1. What did you like most about this subject?

I really liked the concept of the subject, which combined English and coding. English was aimed specifically at my specialty and contained very important information that I will definitely use in the future. Besides tasks were very interesting and with their help I learned a lot of new things. Moreover, I studied the process of coding and the use of Github.

It is also important to note the professional approach of our teacher. He was very interesting and clear in presenting all the information to us. He was able to create an incredibly friendly and pleasant atmosphere in our class, which made this subject my favorite. Our teacher was one of the few people who really understood how hard it was for us this year and did everything possible to help. I can definitely say that this person really loves his job and is a professional. It would be great if there were more teachers like him.

_Mr. Gagne, I want to thank you personally for your patience and support, because not every teacher treats his students so well. And that is really worthy of respect. You are an amazing person and I am very glad that you were our teacher.ðŸ’–_
