# Visual style & communication strategy for the EFEST festival 

## Abstract

This work is based on the process of creating a visual style and developing a communication strategy for the electronic music festival "EFEST". The work consists of two main parts - theoretical and practical.

In the theoretical part, I briefly explain the concept of branding and corporate identity, defining their main functions and tasks, which are realized through the main components. I also describe the role of the communication concept of marketing, its types and ways of influencing consumer behavior. In the last chapter of the theoretical part I analyze the position of cultural events as an important component in the life of society.

The practical part is based on the process of using the theory received in practice. Therefore, the practical part includes all the elements and conditions necessary for the concept of the festival.  First of all, a detailed analysis of the brand to understand its strengths and weaknesses, as well as its position in the market. Then the visual component of the project is created, including full graphic design. Just here I describe the methods used in the advertising program, and how to distribute this advertising. And most importantly, I present the main elements of the impact of communication.
